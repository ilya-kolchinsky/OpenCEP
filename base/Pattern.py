    A pattern has several fields:
    - a structure represented by a tree of operators over the primitive events (e.g., SEQ(A,B*, AND(C, NOT(D), E)));
    - a condition to be satisfied by the primitive events (might consist of multiple nested conditions);
    - a time window for the pattern matches to occur within.
    A pattern can also carry statistics with it, in order to enable advanced
    tree construction mechanisms - this is hopefully a temporary hack.
